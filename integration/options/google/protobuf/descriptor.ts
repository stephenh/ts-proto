  /**
   * A Location identifies a piece of source code in a .proto file which
   * corresponds to a particular definition.  This information is intended
   * to be useful to IDEs, code indexers, documentation generators, and similar
   * tools.
   *
   * For example, say we have a file like:
   *   message Foo {
   *     optional string foo = 1;
   *   }
   * Let's look at just the field definition:
   *   optional string foo = 1;
   *   ^       ^^     ^^  ^  ^^^
   *   a       bc     de  f  ghi
   * We have the following locations:
   *   span   path               represents
   *   [a,i)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0 ]     The whole field definition.
   *   [a,b)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 4 ]  The label (optional).
   *   [c,d)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 5 ]  The type (string).
   *   [e,f)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 1 ]  The name (foo).
   *   [g,h)  [ 4, 0, 2, 0, 3 ]  The number (1).
   *
   * Notes:
   * - A location may refer to a repeated field itself (i.e. not to any
   *   particular index within it).  This is used whenever a set of elements are
   *   logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire
   *   extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will
   *   have an outer location whose path refers to the "extensions" repeated
   *   field without an index.
   * - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single
   *   logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most
   *   obvious example is the "extend" block again -- there may be multiple
   *   extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.
   * - A location's span is not always a subset of its parent's span.  For
   *   example, the "extendee" of an extension declaration appears at the
   *   beginning of the "extend" block and is shared by all extensions within
   *   the block.
   * - Just because a location's span is a subset of some other location's span
   *   does not mean that it is a descendant.  For example, a "group" defines
   *   both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations
   *   corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.
   * - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to
   *   ignore those that it doesn't understand, as more types of locations could
   *   be recorded in the future.

          " Should this field be parsed lazily?  Lazy applies only to message-type\n fields.  It means that when the outer message is initially parsed, the\n inner message's contents will not be parsed but instead stored in encoded\n form.  The inner message will actually be parsed when it is first accessed.\n\n This is only a hint.  Implementations are free to choose whether to use\n eager or lazy parsing regardless of the value of this option.  However,\n setting this option true suggests that the protocol author believes that\n using lazy parsing on this field is worth the additional bookkeeping\n overhead typically needed to implement it.\n\n This option does not affect the public interface of any generated code;\n all method signatures remain the same.  Furthermore, thread-safety of the\n interface is not affected by this option; const methods remain safe to\n call from multiple threads concurrently, while non-const methods continue\n to require exclusive access.\n\n\n Note that implementations may choose not to check required fields within\n a lazy sub-message.  That is, calling IsInitialized() on the outer message\n may return true even if the inner message has missing required fields.\n This is necessary because otherwise the inner message would have to be\n parsed in order to perform the check, defeating the purpose of lazy\n parsing.  An implementation which chooses not to check required fields\n must be consistent about it.  That is, for any particular sub-message, the\n implementation must either *always* check its required fields, or *never*\n check its required fields, regardless of whether or not the message has\n been parsed.\n",

This is used whenever a set of elements are\n   logically enclosed in a single code segment.  For example, an entire\n   extend block (possibly containing multiple extension definitions) will\n   have an outer location whose path refers to the "extensions" repeated\n   field without an index.\n - Multiple locations may have the same path.  This happens when a single\n   logical declaration is spread out across multiple places.  The most\n   obvious example is the "extend" block again -- there may be multiple\n   extend blocks in the same scope, each of which will have the same path.\n - A location\'s span is not always a subset of its parent\'s span.  For\n   example, the "extendee" of an extension declaration appears at the\n   beginning of the "extend" block and is shared by all extensions within\n   the block.\n - Just because a location\'s span is a subset of some other location\'s span\n   does not mean that it is a descendant.  For example, a "group" defines\n   both a type and a field in a single declaration.  Thus, the locations\n   corresponding to the type and field and their components will overlap.\n - Code which tries to interpret locations should probably be designed to\n   ignore those that it doesn\'t understand, as more types of locations could\n   be recorded in the future.\n',
