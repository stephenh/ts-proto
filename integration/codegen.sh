# ./codegen.sh simple value

#    Updates generated output only for the 'simple' and 'value' integration test.

#    Updates generated output for the 'simple' integration test. Used by file watcher.

# Each integration test can optionally have a `parameters.txt` file that will
# be used as the ts-proto_opt... args for generating that test's code.
