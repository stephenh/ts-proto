/**
    Most ORMs ignore the `undefined` value, either we have the value from DB or it's null. 
    with this flag you can have better alignment with your ORM ( drizzle, TypeOrm, PrismaJS, etc) Entities. 
    Or when you wanna share the grpc interfaces with NextJS `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` in which they won't accept `undefined` ( it will cause runtime error )
    please check https://sdorra.dev/posts/2023-03-20-typescript-undefined-to-null for more info
    let's say on querying the database with relations, there might be a value for the relation or not (it's null). 
    with this flag the generated interfaces will be aligned with it. 
    now let's say you have a grpc method which might return user's profile as well or not ( depending on querying the relation or not )
    with `optional` modifier you can replicate this as well. the optional field will have `ProfileInfo | null | undefined (implicitly)`
